<!--Benefits, use-cases of using Istio-->

We've seen the demo of Istio in a microservice application. This is the most basic use case from the istio, which is to provide network-related services manageable through the control plane. But still, multiple capabilities can help leverage the tool in a better manner.

Istio is very good at implementing traffic flow control and communication management. Also, it allows the admins to gain better observability over the cluster. This means it enables monitoring on the network layer and collects the data for analysis of the network traffic. In addition, we can implement addons like `kiali`, `grafana` for visualization of the whole network topology and traffic. Addons help enhance the overall functionality of the service mesh.

Also, Istio can work as a security agent for communication inside the cluster. We can set security access and authorization rules for internal cluster communication and add encryption too.

The major benefits Istio gives are better control in network communication, more observability over the cluster, easy to implement sidecar-based setup, security features, native support with Kubernetes deployment types like `canary`.

These are some features and benefits that istio provides. Implementing them significantly changes the view towards the cluster.
