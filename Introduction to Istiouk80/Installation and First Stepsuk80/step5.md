In this discussion, we explored a very interesting area in cluster administration space. Such services enhance the way we operate the cluster.  A service mesh standardizes and automates security, service discovery and traffic routing, load balancing, service failure recovery, and observability.

Lightweight and easy-to-implement solutions like Istio gives all the above-mentioned feature very feasibly. Using the centralized node we can control, monitor, and route the application traffic. Also, we can add inter-cluster security options that can help preserve sensitive data inside the cluster.

More and more familiarity with their tools and terms will help in building microservice-based applications and add golden colors in administration operations by adding solutions like Istio.!
