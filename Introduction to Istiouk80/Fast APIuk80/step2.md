<!-- Key features -->

FastAPI promises 5 main features:

# Speed
Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go. FastAPI is based on [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette) and [Pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic) one of the [fastest](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#performance) Python frameworks available.

# Speed to code
Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. This estimation (done by FastAPI developers) is based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications.

# Fewer bugs
Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. The estimation is based on the same test.

# Intuitive
Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.

# Easy
Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.

# Short
Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.

# Robust
Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.

# Standards-based
Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (previously known as Swagger) and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

Some projects like [Netflix Dispatch](https://github.com/Netflix/dispatch) are built using FastAPI. Other tech giants such as Facebook, Microsoft and Uber also uses FastAPI to create production-ready REST APIs with few lines of code.
